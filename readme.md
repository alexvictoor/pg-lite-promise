# pg-promise adapter for pg-lite

This library allows to use ultra fast, wasm based, postgres distribution [pg-lite](https://pglite.dev) with postgres interface [pg-promise](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise).
The implementation is strongly inspired from pg-promise adapter in project [pg-mem](https://github.com/oguimbal/pg-mem).
